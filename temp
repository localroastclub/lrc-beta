        "description": "Austin Roasting Company has been around since 2008 and supplies many of the coffee shops as well as individual customers around the Austin area.  Austin Roasting Company is run by some really great people and I've learned a lot through working with them.  Sometimes I wish they had their own coffee shop - but brewing their coffee myself has been just as satisfying.  I suppose their setup allows them to focus more on the process of roasting with as little distraction as possible.  Their beans come from all over the world, are roasted to order, and taste great.  ARC rotates through various microlots from different regions, but also have some consistent blends that are available every week.  My personal favorite is the Zilker Perk! \\n\r\n\\n\r\nHere is a list of their standard coffees (12oz):\\n\r\n\\n\r\nLight Roasts: Lady Bird, Zilker Perk\\n\r\nMedium Roasts:  Red River, Bacon and Eggs\\n\r\n\\n\r\nDark Roasts: Major Gomez, Capital City\\n\r\n\r\nEspresso: Capital City, Red River Espresso\\n\r\n\\n\r\nDecaf: Decaf House Blend Light, Decaf House Blend Dark\\n\r\n\\n\r\nSingle Origins:  Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Papua New Guinea, Peru, as well as Organic Ethiopian and Organic Mexican Chiapas\\n\r\n\\n\r\nIf there's a specific type you'd like just make a note of it on your order! \\n\r\n\\n\r\nTo find out more about ARC, check out their website at:  <a href=\"www.austinroastingcompany.com\">www.austinroastingcompany.com</a>"

        "description": "Barrett's Coffee has been supplying the Austin area for over 20 years, and you've probably tried their coffee at one of your favorite coffee shops around town because Barrett's supplies a hecka shops.  Halycon, Epochs, Bouldin Creek Cafe, Buzzmill, Legend, Frank's Hot Dogs, Cupprimo, and Siste, just to name a few.  As of now, they have finally got a space of their own and run a little coffee shop off St. Johns and Lamar.  Similar to Greater Goods, their selection of single origin microlots is much larger than other roasters, and much larger than their selection of standard blends.  Barrett's are one of our newer roasters so I haven't quite tried all their coffee yet, but from what I have experienced I've really liked them all.  \\n\r\n\\n\r\n\\n\r\nHere is a list of their standard coffees (16oz):\\n\r\n\\n\r\nLight Roasts:  Costa Rican\\n\r\n\\n\r\nMedium Roasts:  St. Johns Signature Blend\\n\r\n\\n\r\nDark Roasts:  St. Lucifer\\n\r\n\\n\r\nIf there's a specific type you'd like just make a note of it on your order!\\n\r\n\\n\r\nYou can find out more information about Barrett's by going to their website here: \\n\r\n<a href=\"www.barrettscoffee.com\">www.barrettscoffee.com</a>"

        "description": "Casa Brasil is real legit, and their coffee tastes great too.  Casa Brasil Coffees began as just a Brazilian Cultural Center in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Austin. Their aim was to help Brazilians living in Central Texas and promote Brazilian culture, and now they are doing so by producing some of the best coffee the city has to offer.  All of the beans are imported from Brazil, which would seem limiting but apparently Brazil is huge and has tons of varying topography and it's amazing.  Casa Brasil's owner has lived in Brazil (he may actually still live down there part of the year - don't quote me) and he made personal connections with various Brazilian coffee farmers to source and just everything about this company is very pro-farmer, pro-organic coffee, pro-doing things right, etc -- which results in a magnificent as well as ethical product.
