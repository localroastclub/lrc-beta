        So you like drinking good coffee, but you’re tired of always having the same brew day after day? Or maybe you’re ready to expand your palette, but don’t know where to start? It can be frustrating mulling through the grocery store coffee aisle without direction. Maybe you just decide on the nicest looking package and go? Or maybe you’ve found some you actually like only to have the grocery store out of stock… every… time… thereafter.

        We’ve been there, frustrated with what the grocery store has to offer (or rather lacks), and the variety at the local coffee shops is usually limited to one roaster-- while good, it is hardly exploratory.  Or maybe you go through enough coffee to get hooked up with a local roaster, but you’ve tried all of their roasts and want to get your hands on something new. Here at the Local Roast Club a group of us got together to end our frustrations, and it has been so awesome having quality coffee without having to think twice that we wanted to include you, our fellow coffee adventurer, to try out new roasts without spending all the time and energy driving around town for something you’re uncertain you would even like.

        Joining the club gives you the benefits of:
