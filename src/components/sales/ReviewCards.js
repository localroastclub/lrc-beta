            I used to buy the cheap big-box coffees and for some time was getting major heartburn every morning. I pivoted to nicer coffees, like those at LRC, and never looked back.

          I love trying new coffees and learning about roasts and bean origins that I like, but rarely have time to drive across town to different coffee shops. Cue Local Roast, now I donâ€™t have to drive around or put in multiple orders from different roasters every month, they take care of it all for me and I can explore coffees with ease!
