      So why have we come to treat coffee this way? Coffee is roasted with a shelf life-- the best flavors are obtained within one month of roasting. Yet most grocery stores don’t even include a roast date on their coffees. It’s no wonder we’re taught to drown our coffee with sugar and cream. Why not replace those calories with a delicious breakfast, and enjoy your coffee guilt-free?
